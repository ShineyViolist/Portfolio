    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Jeremy Shiju. I am a programmer. I started programming when I was introduced to this program called whitehat. Here I fell in love with programming, and have been continuing that journey every since.</p>

    <h3><center><i>Pong</i></center></h3>

    <center><caption>This is a game of pong.</caption></center>
    <div></div>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The first project I embarked on was the game of pong. This was a simple but fun way to interest me in programming. We used code.org to code this project. If you aren't familiar with the game of pong, you pass a ball to a computer, and vice versa, until one of you misses.</p>

    <h3><center><i>Underground Maze</i></center></h3>

    <a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/uxcApQkEd6Y8zJm6pSaoBXeZ4nYw5glAeshPErAcsXA"><center><img src="maze.png" alt="This is the underground maze."></center></a>
    <div></div>
    <center><caption>This is the underground maze.</caption></center>
    <div></div>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next project I created was the underground maze. Here you played as a catterpillar avoiding the other insects so that you don't get caught.</p>
    <div></div>

    <h3><center><i>Ship Blast</i></center></h3>
    <div></div>

    <div></div>
    <center><caption>This is Ship Blast.</caption></center>
    <div></div>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To enhance my ability to code, we worked on a project called Ship Blast. In this game, we used princables that we learned before to create a game were to play as a ship protecting the world from invaders.</p>
    <div></div> 

    <h3><center><i>Trex Game</i></center></h3>
    <div></div>
    <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/whitehatjr/sketches/ePJrHCACM"><center><img src="trex.png" alt="This is the trex game."></center></a>
    <div></div>
    <center><caption>This is the trex game.</caption></center>
    <div></div>
    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp To advance our skills in coding, we used p5.web editor to mimic the "no internet trex game." This was a very fun project where we implemented graphics, sounds and my pricable to make a fun and interactive game.</p>
